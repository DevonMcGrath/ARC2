# ARC Config File
# Author: Devon McGrath
# Syntax:
#   Lines that start with '#' are ignored.
#   Empty lines are also ignored.
#   Each line is a key-value pair in the syntax: <key>=<value>
#       For example, JAVA=/usr/bin/java
#   To create values dependent on others, use ${<key>}.
#       For example, if ${ROOT}=./src then:
#       ${ROOT}/lib would evaluate to:
#       ./src/lib
#   Boolean values only require the key to be present for the value to be set.
#
# Order for determining actual value:
# If both the ARC Config File and ARC Project Config File have the same key,
# the project file's value will be used.
#
# Invalid keys:
# S             (always set to the system path separator, i.e. / or \)
# ROOT          (always set to the directory where the ARC Config File is located)
# PROJECT_DIR   (always set to the directory where ARC is storing the project)
# ARC_DIR       (always set to ${ROOT}${S}ARC, which is used to place files and
#               directories relevant to the run in)
# LIB_DIR       (always set to ${ROOT}${S}lib, which contains all the libraries
#               such as JUnit and the mutation operators)
# TMP_DIR       (used by ARC to store the individuals during the GA phase)
# MUTANT_DIR    (used by ARC to store all mutations of individuals)
