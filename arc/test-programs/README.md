# Test programs

The programs in this directory can be used to test ARC2. Each program in this directory has the necessary files to be loaded by ARC2:
- An Ant `build.xml`
- A set of `JUnit` test-suites
- An ARC2 config file, `arc-config.txt`

## Program Sources
Unless otherwise identified, all programs come from the IBM suite of concurrent programs with bugs.
