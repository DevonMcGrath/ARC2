# ARC Project File
# Author: Devon McGrath
# Syntax:
#   Lines that start with '#' are ignored.
#   Empty lines are also ignored.
#   Each line is a key-value pair in the syntax: <key>=<value>
#       For example, JAVA=/usr/bin/java
#   To create values dependent on others, use ${<key>}.
#       For example, if ${ROOT}=./src then:
#       ${ROOT}/lib would evaluate to:
#       ./src/lib
#   Boolean values only require the key to be present for the value to be set.
#
# Order for determining actual value:
# If both the ARC Config File and ARC Project Config File have the same key,
# the project file's value will be used.
